            <h1><strong>Choices</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The elderly have choices to make around becoming digitally literate. This is a personal choice and one that 
                would vastly depend on their situation. Becoming smartphone savvy is something that takes time, effort and 
                money and not everyone is lucky enough to have the opportunity to learn. However, the choice should be 
                theirs and there should be opportunities like adapted smartphones or classes to help them in their digital 
                literacy journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned previously in the opportunity section, there are a few choices of smartphones that would be 
                easy to learn how to use, the Nokia 3.4 and Google Pixel 7. The Nokia 3.4 is an inexpensive phone, with all 
                the basic features covered – texting, calling, internet access, camera, and some storage. With a low cost, 
                durable material and a pretty simple interface this is a great option for someone who is not used to using 
                a phone. The Google Pixel is another suitable choice, reasonably priced, fast, accessible and easy to use, 
                and one of the easiest interfaces to navigate. It is dust and water resistance which is great for users who
                may be a bit clumsy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, smartphones aren’t the only way to use technology. Tablets or iPads have larger, more 
                accessible screens and cellular tablets can be taken everywhere. One of these tablets is the GrandPad. 
                This specially designed tablet is perfect for the eldery: designed for seniors with little or no computer 
                experience, a highly encrypted network that ensures no spam or scams, permanent customer support with a 
                trained and dedicated team, and of course, super easy navigation with a large text size.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, elderly people should always be allowed the choice of whether to learn how to use 
                smartphones or not. We as individuals can also choose to help them in ways such as the local classes 
                to educate them on the effectiveness of smartphones and how to stay connected and protect themselves from 
                scams and frauds. There is also the choice that we don’t help much at all, but we must realize that that 
                could be us in the future, and setting an example could have a great impact on the younger generation to 
                help us if we can’t keep up with the new technology. The elderly should each be given their own choice and
                to not force them to learn, but they should be given options to become technologically literate.
