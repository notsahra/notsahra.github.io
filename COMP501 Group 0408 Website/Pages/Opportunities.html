            <h1><strong>Opportunities</strong></h1>
            <p>
                There are many opportunities to make smartphones more useable for the elderly, for example, changing 
                interfaces to accommodate users who might have a hard time seeing. This could be implemented through 
                changes such as larger text sizes, the option for text-to-speech, and simplification of navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ideally, there would be smartphones that are designed for the elderly however, as of now there are no 
                mainstream smartphones that fit the criteria. A few good options in the current range of smartphones 
                include the Nokia 3.4 or the Google Pixel 7, which we will talk a bit more about in the choices section.
            </p>
            <p>
                Digital literacy training for the elderly specifically, using adapted interfaces would help them to 
                understand the advantages of having a smartphone, as well as how to navigate through it, and the essential 
                apps. This could be implemented at local libraries as part of their educational classes, spots frequented 
                by the elderly, such as community centers or online tutorials/website and tech/instructor-based training 
                programs. This support, especially when continuous, will build confidence in elder’s technology illiteracy 
                and give them the essential skills in today’s digital climate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Laptop checkout programs developed by local libraries are an example of an opportunity for the elderly to
                adapt to technology. Libraries introducing digital technology workshops and classes that provide hyperlinks
                to trustworthy web resources for finding medical and health-related information such as
                <a href="http://medlineplus.gov">medlineplus.gov</a> can be a big help in those elderly who are struggling 
                in gathering important information. In addition, assisting in the decision-making process for health and 
                medical-related issues. This decrease computer anxiety the elderly may have and increase computer interest 
                to improve their technology illiteracy (Xie B & Bugg J, 2009).
            </p>
            <p>
                Online tutorials/website opportunities such as Senior Planet operated by OATS provides digital literacy 
                training for the elderly. Senior Planet prepares weekly classes that teaches how to conduct internet 
                research using tactics including analyzing websites, determining the source of the material and finding 
                tools for fact-checking as elderly are easily troubled by fake news. This motivates elderly to stay away 
                from confirmation bias traps and encourages independent thought and cognitive growth (Nash S,2019).
            </p>
            <p>
                Instructor-based training is a great opportunity as it includes task performance, social relationships
                and increase elderly well-being, In-person settings and incorporates interaction and socialization with
                instructors and fellow senior learners. Instructor-based training for seniors can form significant social
                ties that are vital to their wellbeing and social support. Because of the group settings, which can lessen
                the sense of isolation, this advances their sense of confidence and inclusion. Additionally, the social
                contacts that take place during computer training will contribute to the beneficial relationship between
                technology training and elderly well-being. (Xie B & Bugg J, 2009) As they share their experiences
                with overcoming difficulties, other elderly people become more motivated to learn about technology to
                become efficient at using digital tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assisting the elderly to understand a wide range of opportunities the internet or community has to offer 
                and encourage elderly with guidance, will provide them reassurance in adapting with digital technology 
                as adopting to technology is a slow process for elderly, patience is needed therefore these opportunities 
                are beneficial among consistent support and willingness.
