            <h1><strong>Risks</strong></h1>
            <p>
                Being elderly with poor technology literacy skills means there will be missed opportunities, as the 
                world we live in is gradually going digital. Many necessary services are now available online. Without the 
                ability to use these digital tools, the elderly will have difficulty accessing and are thus excluded from 
                these key resources which include banking online, medical gateways, services provided by the government, 
                shopping online, and more (Akinola.S, 2021).
            </p>
                Technology is being used more and more for social contact and communication. Senior citizens who lack 
            technology literacy will be unable to stay in touch with friends and family using digital technologies, which 
            can add to a sense of isolation because they are cut off from the ties they most long for (Conger.k & 
            Griffith.E, 2020).
            <p>
                Social responsibility towards the elderly who don't adapt to modern day technology is a risk. They stress 
                that technology will substitute in person conversation and increase the feeling of loneliness. They enjoy 
                traditional methods of engaging communication to the community such as face to face contact or involvement 
                in daily errands. They fear technology services will take opportunities such as business and jobs from 
                important institutions like banks if they don't physically go themselves. The elderly reject modern day 
                technology out of guilt because it will harm their social ties (Lancaster University, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>
                The elderly are vulnerable to digital fraud, due to their low level of technology literacy and an inability 
                to secure important information. Low level of financial literacy is regularly found among the elderly. 
                This leads to them having difficulties recognizing fraud when encountering it. Looking at how the financial 
                system has grown over time, the elderly lack the digital literacy training necessary to overcome these 
                obstacles. Technology improvements and the digitalization of financial services might provide challenges 
                for elderly people who are not as comfortable or accustomed to accessing online resources. Social isolation 
                serves a significant risk aspect of fraud vulnerability, especially for senior citizens who tend to be 
                lonelier. Scammers will pretend to feel sympathy for the elder’s issues, which manipulates the elder’s 
                emotions and creates trust, which later leads to scams. Elderly people who are socially isolated have a 
                strong psychological need to interact with different people, often complete strangers, makes them easier 
                targets for scam artists. Psychological vulnerability is also leading to the effects of social isolation and 
                identified inadequate stratification of social desires. Over time we can estimate future incidents of 
                fraud, especially vulnerable elderly, who are twice as likely to be taken advantage of. Lichtenberg et al. 
                2016 focuses on the significance of taking psychological vulnerability into account when calculating fraud 
                susceptibility. Elderly focus more on the false benefits that the scam artists claim them to be, thus 
                resulting in the elderly to feel good as they analyze the fake data. They are prone to disregard the 
                unlikely factors of the fraud situation that could trigger concerns (Shao.J, Zhang.Q, Ren.Y, Li.X & Lin.T, 
                2019).

            <p>
                According to total loss data from the FTC's (2020) full year, seen there is a higher percentage of younger 
                groups fraud lost, there is a higher amounts of fraud loss for elderly. In addition, the age group 60 and 
                over reported losses of $436 to $1300 points up how elderly are easy targets to digital fraud for example 
                in the pandemic era.

            <p>
                According to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data (2019), online contact was the main method of scamming 
                elderly people in general. Age 70 and older, phone calls were mostly used contact method targeting the 
                elderly.

                By addressing those risks. This raises the recognition of the significance of further research into the 
                risks and improvements in technology experienced by the elderly ageing. Newer attempts should be made to 
                tackle and boost technology literacy.
