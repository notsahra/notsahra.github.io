            <h1><strong>Technology/Topic and their Impact on Society</strong></h1>
            <p>
                In a world where smartphones are an essential tool in our lives, we must remember that
                this is not the case for everyone, not everyone has adapted to daily, heavy reliance on
                technology. While the latest generation has easily transitioned into this new digital
                world, many seniors still struggle to understand and use smartphones. In today’s
                increasingly digital world this gap between the elderly and their ability to use
                smartphones creates this new issue – the elderly’s current smartphone illiteracy is
                leaving them behind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The phrase “smartphone illiteracy” describes the challenges that people encounter while
                trying to understand and use smartphones. Modern smartphones are very different from
                what elderly people grew up and used for most of their lives, they have many applications,
                tools and can be intimidating for those who are not used to them. Senior citizens are
                used to more traditional means of communication and technology, like landline telephones
                or mailing letters, while mobile phones are extremely different.
            </p>
            <p>
                The elderly and their current smartphone illiteracy is a topic that really showcases the
                challenges faced by older generations as they struggle to adapt to rapidly advancing
                technology. This is particularly relevant today as the world’s population continues to
                age, the number of the elderly increases. In fact, by 2050, the world population of
                older people will be around 400 million.

            <p>
                In recent years, the use of technology, especially smartphones, has become prominent.
                According to statista (2022) by the end of 2020, 78.05% of the world’s population used
                smartphones. While some senior citizens have become technologically competent, a
                significant portion still struggles interacting with newer technologies, which means
                certain elderly people are excluded from some essential services (like healthcare or
                shopping) and are being left behind in this increasingly digital society.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many reasons that the elderly have yet to adapt to modern smartphones –
                one of these is the design of smartphones. Typically, smartphones are small touchscreen
                devices that connect users to the internet. These smartphones were not designed with the
                elderly in mind, the user interface has small font size which can be difficult for those
                with vision issues, the touchscreen may be inconvenient for those with dexterity
                problems, and smartphones have a very complex navigation system, especially for new
                users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another determinant for smartphone illiteracy among senior citizens is the rapid change
                in technology. Technology is evolving at an extremely fast pace, with new smartphones
                coming out every year, there is an overwhelming amount of constant learning to not fall
                behind. This continuously changing environment is demanding, and it takes effort and
                time to learn the newest software updates – not to mention the cost of upgrading your
                phone, which may not seem important for those who don’t fully understand the use of
                smartphones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the elderly have had less exposure and training compared to younger generations.
                While Gen Z and Gen Alpha been brought up with technology ingrained in their education
                and lives, the older generations have not. There is a lack of training programs on how
                to use technology, it is just assumed that everyone will know how to use it. Without
                proper guidance and support there is little opportunities for the elderly to learn and
                adapt to new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the current smartphone illiteracy in the elderly is a topic that has an impact
                on today’s technologically advanced society. Senior citizens face some challenges in the
                way of becoming smartphone literate, like design limitations, constant change in
                technology, and lack of exposure and training. Acknowledging and learning the importance
                of smartphone literacy is so important in todays society and by addressing the issues
                the elderly confront, we can create a more inclusive technological society for all
                generations.
