                The elderly and their current smartphone illiteracy is a topic that really showcases the challenges faced by older generations as they struggle to 
                adapt to rapidly advancing technology. This is particularly relevant today as the world’s population continues to age, the number of the elderly 
                increases. In fact, by 2050, the world population of older people will triple (Hong et al., 2016).

                In recent years, the use of technology, especially smartphones, has become prominent. According to statista (2022) by the end of 2020, 78.05% of 
                the world’s population used smartphones. While some of the elderly have become technologically competent, a significant portion still struggles 
                interacting with newer technologies, creating a digital device. This digital divide means certain elderly people are excluded from some essential 
                services (like healthcare or shopping) and are being left behind in this increasingly digital society.
